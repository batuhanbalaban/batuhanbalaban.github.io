I'm Batuhan, `Sereverless Software Architect` and `Full-Stack Developer` from London.

With over 13 years of deep-rooted experience in software development, I specialize in building cloud-native applications that leverage the power and flexibility of Serverless architecture and AWS Cloud. My focus is on crafting end-to-end solutions using modern tools like Node.js, TypeScript, React.js, and AWS CDK, ensuring that infrastructure is as agile and scalable as the code itself. Whether it's architecting resilient microservices or implementing Infrastructure as Code, I’m driven by the challenge of transforming complex requirements into streamlined, performant systems.

I approach development with a DevOps mindset, integrating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that empower rapid iteration and deployment. My commitment to using cutting-edge technologies and best practices in cloud architecture ensures that the solutions I build not only meet today’s demands but are prepared for tomorrow’s innovations. If you're looking to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the cloud, let's connect.
